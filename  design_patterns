There are several design patterns commonly used in software development. Some of the most well-known ones include:

Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Builder Pattern: Helps in constructing complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Abstract Factory Pattern: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Prototype Pattern: Allows an object to create customized objects without knowing their class or any details of how to create them.

Adapter Pattern: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.

Bridge Pattern: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexities from clients.

Proxy Pattern: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. It chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.

Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.

These patterns help solve common design problems in software development and promote code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility.
